# ATSFPHO
Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Prophet and Hyperparameter Optimization Project Description This challenge is designed for advanced students aiming to build a robust time series forecasting pipeline using Facebook’s Prophet model. The focus is on rigorous hyperparameter tuning and uncertainty quantification.


Dataset Requirements
Participants should work with complex, real-world datasets such as:

Historical stock prices

High-frequency sensor data

Detailed energy consumption logs

The project emphasizes handling:

Seasonality

Holidays

Trend changes

Key Tasks
✅ Employ advanced optimization techniques (e.g., Bayesian Optimization using Hyperopt or Optuna) to find the best model configuration that minimizes forecasting error (e.g., RMSE or MAPE) on a validation set.

✅ Analyze prediction intervals and discuss uncertainty implications in a business context.

✅ Deliver a comprehensive analysis of the tuning process, rationale for chosen hyperparameters, and compare the optimized model against a baseline (e.g., ARIMA or simple exponential smoothing).

✅ Ensure production-quality code with:

Version control best practices

Clear documentation (e.g., docstrings)
