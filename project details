Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Prophet and Hyperparameter Optimization

This project challenges advanced students to implement a robust time series forecasting pipeline using Facebook's Prophet model, focusing heavily on rigorous hyperparameter tuning and uncertainty quantification. Students will utilize a complex, real-world dataset (e.g., historical stock prices, high-frequency sensor data, or detailed energy consumption logs) to ensure the complexities of seasonality, holidays, and trend changes are adequately addressed.

The core of the project involves moving beyond default Prophet settings by employing advanced optimization techniques, such as Bayesian Optimization (using libraries like Hyperopt or Optuna), to find the optimal model configuration that minimizes forecasting error (e.g., RMSE or MAPE) on a held-out validation set.

Furthermore, students must critically analyze the model's prediction intervals and discuss the implications of uncertainty in a business context.

The final deliverable requires a comprehensive, text-based analysis detailing:

The tuning process

The rationale behind the chosen hyperparameters

A comparison of the optimized model's performance against a baseline (like ARIMA or simple exponential smoothing)

Production-quality code, including version control best practices and clear documentation (docstrings), is mandatory.

🔵 Tasks to Complete
